# Notes on 16 Jun. 2023

## Agenda

Discuss Zygote PR: [https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl/pull/1419](https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl/pull/1419)

Discuss distributed ML (lead by Julian Samaroo)

Discuss DiffImages.jl (lead by Ashwani Rathee)â€”better collaboration with FluxML

Zygote PR discussion:
- Jax's `hax_aux` flag seems awkward to handle
- What's the alternative interpretation for a tuple other than a gradient + auxiliary info?
    - From `pullback`'s perspective: multiple sensitivities
    - Multiple sensitivities should be called something other than `gradient`
- Final resolution:
    - Interpretation in the PR is good (no need for a flag)
    - Do we want the same semantics for `gradient`?

Distributed discussion:
- Julian is interested in expanding data parallelism through Dagger.jl for Flux
- We had a discussion about various models of parallelism in other frameworks:
    - https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html
    - https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15704
- Main current issue is lack of `all_reduce` without CPU sync in Julia
- Julian is looking for people interested on the ML side to work with him
- GSoC student working on Dagger + MPI integration
- Kyle will share Metalhead.jl training script to Julia as starting point

GPU memory usage optimizer:
- Julian has extended escape analysis PRs on Base Julia to eagerly free allocated GPU memory for Flux models
- Looking for someone with interest + time to work on a project to analyze Julia IR for models to determine how to free arrays early
    - Some compiler expertise will be helpful
- Brian brought up how this is a tricky project because forward pass buffers cannot be freed since Zygote's pullback can be called multiple times
- Julian can provide mentorship on this project

Discussion on DiffImages.jl deferred offline due to internet issues.
