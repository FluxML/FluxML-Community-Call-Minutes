## Minutes

Metalhead discussion:
- Abhirath's primary focus is landing more docs
- Future directions for Metalhead
    - Keep Metalhead just about vision models + checkpoints
    - Expand to image segmentation
    - Convenience wrappers for image preprocessing in another repo (or tutorials)
    - Write tutorials that are visual and runnable
    - Quarto might be a good option that works with Documenter.jl: https://forem.julialang.org/kellertuer/render-quarto-tutorials-in-documenterjl-with-github-actions-3fo
    - Pluto.jl has support for execution barriers now: https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/pull/985
- Move to MultiDocumenter.jl for FluxML
    - Abhirath will lead this effort

Enzyme + Flux integration:
- On CPU, we need rules for conv due to threading
- GPU needs more work
- Prior work: https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Enzyme.jl/issues/805
- Optimizing with Enzyme output using Optimisers.jl:
  ```julia
  # Enzyme fills in dmodel using link above
  # if dmodel doesn't work directly then do this line first
  # dmodel = Functors.fmapstructure(identity, dmodel)
  model, opt = Optimisers.update!(opt, model, dmodel)
  ```

Llama2 + Whisper integration:
- Whisper.jl already uses Flux: https://github.com/JuliaNeuralGraphics/Whisper.jl
- Llama2.jl/LanguageModels.jl is low-tech and does not use Flux intentionally
- Transformers.jl already has support for Llama2 with Flux
- Relevant thread on Transformers.jl + LoRA updates: https://julialang.slack.com/archives/C7LFJTXV5/p1691663017942109

Jonathan Starr:
- Joined NumFOCUS recently
- Leading effort on open source science within NumFOCUS (called OSSci)
- Connect open source communities to academics
- Funding mandates for open source
- Map of open source science: https://map.opensource.science/
    - Would be good to get FluxML on there
    - Contribute by commenting here: https://community.opensource.science/

Questions about calling Huggingface Transformers for inference in Julia:
- Prior work on training through PyCall.jl: https://github.com/rejuvyesh/PythonCallChainRules.jl
- Prior work on Huggingface API in Julia: https://github.com/FluxML/HuggingFaceApi.jl
- No tooling for inference
