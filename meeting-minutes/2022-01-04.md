# Notes on 4 Jan. 2022

## Agenda

- FastAI.jl updates
    - Improved block-based learning methods to support non-supervised learning tasks ([Variational Autoencoder tutorial](https://fluxml.ai/FastAI.jl/dev/notebooks/vae.ipynb.html); [PR](https://github.com/FluxML/FastAI.jl/pull/188))
    - Refactored functionality by domains, e.g. all vision-related functionality in `FastAI.Vision` ([PR](https://github.com/FluxML/FastAI.jl/pull/188))
- [MLUtils.jl](https://github.com/JuliaML/MLUtils.jl/issues/2)
    - Porting MLDataPattern.jl ([PR](https://github.com/JuliaML/MLUtils.jl/issues/3))
    - Not tracking `obsdim` throughout
    - Porting FastAI.jl ([ref](https://github.com/FluxML/FastAI.jl/issues/22))

## Minutes

Lorenz gave minor updates on FastAI.jl (see agenda)

Discussion on MLUtils.jl
- Will cover all of the functionality in MLDataPattern.jl
- Prototype in MLUtils.jl -> push to MLDataUtils.jl
- Use wrapper types for observations not being default
    - Coordinate this with JuliaStats?
- Port dataset transforms from FastAI.jl to MLUtils.jl
- Port data containers to MLDatasets.jl (as planned)

### Chat transcript

```
11:09:43	 From Manikya Bardhan : Hey everyone!
11:10:30	 From Brian Chen : hey Manikya!
11:10:59	 From Kyle Daruwalla : https://github.com/JuliaML/MLUtils.jl/issues/2
11:12:48	 From Kyle Daruwalla : https://github.com/JuliaML/MLDataUtils.jl
11:15:15	 From Brian Chen : Beating PyTorch to the punch ;) https://youtu.be/Jf99C5Qm8cc
11:15:46	 From Kyle Daruwalla : https://github.com/FluxML/FastAI.jl/issues/22
11:16:46	 From Brian Chen : BTW Milan Bouchet-Valat (@nalimilan) was open to coordinating between JuliaML and JuliaStats.
11:20:53	 From Brian Chen : I've been skimming the PRs and they all look good so far, watching the repo for when more come in
11:22:19	 From Brian Chen : i think Carlo has a PR for a container type that slices an array along one dim, yeah
11:22:29	 From Brian Chen : which solves this discrepancy
11:23:20	 From Brian Chen : so with that, we may be able to replace the custom numobs with StatsAPI.nobs. that can be revisited before registration though
11:24:05	 From Manikya Bardhan : Nothing from my side
11:24:44	 From Brian Chen : happy new year, thanks all :)
```
