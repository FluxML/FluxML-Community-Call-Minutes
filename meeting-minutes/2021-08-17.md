# Notes on 17 Aug 2021

## Agenda

- Manikya will present his GSoC work on tabular methods for FastAI.jl
- Lorenz will give a preview of [FasterAI](https://github.com/FluxML/FastAI.jl/pull/151)

## Minutes

Manikya demoed a complete tabular classification example, highlighting the use of `BlockMethod`s to encode the input/output data types, tabular augmentations, and a customizable `TabularModel`.

Lorenz have a [demo of FasterAI](https://lorenzoh.github.io/posts/fasterai.jl.html). We now support state-of-the-art training for various learning tasks in _five lines of code_:
```julia
data, blocks = loaddataset("imagenette2-320", (Image{2}, Label))
method = ImageClassificationSingle(blocks)
learner = methodlearner(method, data)
fitonecycle!(learner)
plotpredictions(method, learner)
```

Combining our high level API + Pluto.jl results in a GUI no-code interface.

11:13:09 From Vinay Ethiraj:
	Thank you for the presentation, Can you integrate ray tune with the training?

11:16:55 From Brian Chen:
	Just to clarify, you can do all of this with the lower level abstractions in FastAI.jl

11:17:08 From Brian Chen:
	The purpose of this demo is to show off the higher-level features

11:18:19 From Vinay Ethiraj:
	Thank you, I was wondering if there is a top-level flag that you can set that will distribute the training on multiple nodes

11:18:48 From Brian Chen:
	@Vinay Ray support would require them export some kind of C API for us to use, but distributed training support for Flux in general is being worked on in https://github.com/DhairyaLGandhi/DaggerFlux.jl.

11:19:15 From Vinay Ethiraj:
	Awesome thank you!

11:19:27 From Brian Chen:
	These parts are meant to be composable, so having FastAI know about the distributed training would be going against that

11:21:11 From Vinay Ethiraj:
	Got it (Y)

	Thank you for the demo
