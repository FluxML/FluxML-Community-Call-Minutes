Overview of DifferentiationInterface:
- Recent additions for ML and SciML use cases
- Common AD operators (e.g. `gradient`) for various AD backends (`AutoZygote`, etc.)
- Intenal routing for operators not defined by backends (but taking advantage of the features of the specific backend as well as possible)
- Allows "preparation" to create backend specific objects to speed up operator evaluations
- "Sparse backends" to support sparse Hessian computation
- NEW: Ability to differentiate functions of multiple arguments w.r.t. the first argument
- NEW: Testing only for arrays/scalars; but complex data structures are forwarded to the backend (will error if not allowed by backend)
    - Custom `isapprox` functions for testing gradients returned by different backends on complex data structures
- Kyle asked about "preparing" forward mode data structure for complex objects
    - Not supported right now, but there are functions we could hook into once made publicly part of the interface
- Discussion about GPU testing
- Julian wants to use DI in Dagger for testing
- Discussion about `Float32` testing
