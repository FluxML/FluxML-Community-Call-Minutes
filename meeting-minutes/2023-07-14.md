Decision on `@compact` was to move it to Flux proper, but we will include in the docstring that this should primarily be used for small, simple layers.

Update on memory management + distributed training:
- Julian is busy with JuliaCon
- Possible progress at hackathon post-JuliaCon
- Brian, Kyle, Julian will create a repo to seed the static memory management work
- Kyle will upload training script
