Improvements to DataAugmentations.jl and MLDatasets.jl:
- @adrhill has made https://github.com/adrhill/ImageNetDataset.jl
    - Based on https://github.com/JuliaML/MLDatasets.jl/pull/146/files
- Interest in porting these changes over to MLDatasets.jl and DataAugmentation.jl
- Brian and Kyle need to review
- Kyle needs to fix DataAugmentation docs so we can first cut a release
- Changes to DataAugmentation to support "inverse" transforms
    - Are these real inverses or viewing the output of a pipeline back in image space (so only reversing color transformations, etc.)?
    - How much is already covered by https://github.com/FluxML/DataAugmentation.jl/blob/master/src/visualization.jl?

Lux has PR for distributed training support: https://github.com/LuxDL/Lux.jl/pull/500/files
- Seems NCCL revival is complete for supporting DL use cases
- `DistributedUtils` submodule already defines primitives for ComponentArrays and NamedTuples
- Should be easy to make a Flux/Lux agnostic port depending only on Optimisers.jl
