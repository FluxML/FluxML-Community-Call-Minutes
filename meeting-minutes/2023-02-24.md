# Notes on 24 Feb. 2023

## Agenda

No agenda, open for questions.

## Minutes

- Discussed [GSoC benchmarking project](http://fluxml.ai/gsoc/#benchmark_tooling_for_common_models_and_operations)
    - GH Actions or GH apps (bots)?
    - Buildkite is separate from GH and where we have the most compute resources
    - Focus on a flexible benchmarking package that is CI agnostic, then invoke from CI
    - Ability to choose hardware platform to subset benchmarking suite
- Discussed inference slowdown in `LayerNorm`
    - Comes from [partial sums in `normalise`](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl/blob/master/src/layers/normalise.jl) (i.e. `Base.mean` and `Base.std`)
    - Cross-reference to Flax code: https://github.com/google/flax/blob/587f6148d1877bf1321b4e42103a2bd81c1f559d/flax/linen/experimental/layers_with_named_axes.py#L194-L214
        - This is 15x faster with `jax.jit`
    - Possibly because Flax code is "fused" by the tracer whereas our `mean` and `std` calls are separate
