# Notes on 12 Jan. 2024

## Agenda

- Discuss Zygote PRs:
    - https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl/pull/1491
    - https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl/pull/1488
    - https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl/pull/1489

## Minutes

PR: https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl/pull/1491
- Tests pass, seems like a reasonable change
- Are there unintended/untested consequences?
- Based on linked Julia PR, semantics of `accum` should match `x + y` not `x .+ y`

PR: https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl/pull/1488
- Change seems good to go
- Minor issues like naming anonymous functions
- Why is `Base.Broadcast.Broadcasted(::Nothing)` marked as non-differentiable?
    - Enters call stack via `copyto!(::Buffer, ::Broadcasted{Nothing})` mechanism
    - But gradient should be `nothing` anyways

PR: https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl/pull/1489
- Originally adapting `Iterators.product` pullback for scalar iterators, but augmented for inferrability
- Scalar-related changes isolated to original lines 282 and 283—all other changes seem to be for type stability
- Unclear why swapping `ntuple` construction for `map` is more type stable
- Unclear why using a `Vector{Int}` for `dims` is more type stable than an `ntuple`
- Changes for type stability appear to be functionally the same as original—so this is good to go sans uncertainty about _why_ it is more type stable
