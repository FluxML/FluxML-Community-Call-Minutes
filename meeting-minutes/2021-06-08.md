# Notes on 8 June 2021



## Agenda
N/A, nothing planned in advance

## Minutes
- Summary of progress on FastAI.jl tabular
    - Manikya tentatively to present during next ML/AD call
- Nested `Params` discussion (re. https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl/pull/823)
    - Users should not be using `params` for functionality like L2
        - We should document this and provide some alternative functionality
    - Can `params` just throw in a gradient context?
        -   Constructing params in a gradient context is still useful, but has sharp edges
- `Zeros` redux
    - Should be a proper array like `OneHot`
    - Would unblock Optimisers.jl and more
- FluxBench.jl and speed.fluxml.ai
    - Mostly set up, Dhairya will look into moving the bot part over to FluxML
- Symbolics.jl discussion
    - Is it appropriate for improving performance of semi-static flux models?
    - How and who handles memory-related optimizations like buffer reuse and out-of-place -> in-place re-writing?
        - CUDA.jl can do some of the former, unclear on the latter
    - What else needs to be done to reduce memory overhead from the framework and AD side?
    - Plan to discuss in detail at the next ML/AD call
