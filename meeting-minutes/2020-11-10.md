# Notes on 10 November 2020

## Agenda
- Should we sync with https://github.com/FluxML/fluxml.github.io/pull/73 on ecosystem documentation?
- [Proposed] Flux(Training)/DLPipelines and MLJ: are there any opportunities to share/integrate common functionality?
  - If not, what (if anything) can be done to make it so?
- [WIP documentation](https://lorenzoh.github.io/DataAugmentation.jl/dev/docs/imagetransforms.html) for DataAugmentation.jl
