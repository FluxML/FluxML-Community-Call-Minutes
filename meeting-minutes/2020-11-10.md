# Notes on 10 November 2020

## Agenda

- Reorganizing projects/design docs
	- [Org-wide triage project][1]
	- [New design doc wiki][2]
- Maintenance of non-core repos / triage update
- Should we sync with [https://github.com/FluxML/fluxml.github.io/pull/73][3] on ecosystem documentation?
- [Proposed] Flux(Training)/DLPipelines and MLJ: are there any opportunities to share/integrate common functionality?
	  - If not, what (if anything) can be done to make it so?
- [WIP documentation][4] for DataAugmentation.jl

Updates on organization:
- Triage is org-wide (see above)
	- Still need to migrate issues
- Design doc is associated with ML-Coordination-Tracker repo (see above)
- FluxML/community team can help review issues and PRs for non-core repos like model-zoo or Metalhead.jl

### Documentation

There is a GSOD student working on updating the FluxML website. Notably, they mention our repos like DLPipelines.jl, so we should try to sync up. Action items:
- Call with Dhairya and student
- Establish centralized tracking for all the doc improvements across website, Flux.jl docs, secondary package docs

This also lead to a discussion on documentation in general. In particular, *what* we should document and *where* should it go. In terms of organization, we concluded that:
- Docs for packages like FluxTraining.jl, etc. can be under fluxml.github.io domain
- FastAI.jl ties everything together, so it is a good place for high-level tutorials
- We should have forward pointers from Flux.jl docs to other packages
Also, we discussed some of the goals from documentation:
- Several people reiterated points from the last ML committers call:
	- Repetition is good
	- Use a top-down approach like fast.ai (the first thing seen should be beginner friendly)
- Have good continuity from high-level docs to the meat of the package
	- Flux excels at easy extensibility — we should promote that in the docs
	- Abstractions should be useful tools not barriers to understanding the underlying code
- Support for unconventional models/training procedures
	- These tutorials should go in model-zoo (ideally for benchmarking)

### Data Augmentation

The docs for DataAugmentation.jl are [updated][6].

Dale and Lorenz had a call previously to discuss the medical user story. A summary of their discussion can be found on [the tracker issue][7]. Dale was stalled on the augmentation stage, but he will refer to the updated docs and try to move forward.

### DLPipelines.jl and MLJ

The original discussion can be found on [Zulip (#ml-ecosystem-coordination \> DLPipelines.jl)][8]. The main goal is to discuss interoperability between DLPipelines.jl and MLJ. Lorenz provided us with a summary of the conclusions:
- Use the MLJ abstractions to wrap the `Learner` from FluxTraining as MLJ model
- Use the MLJ abstractions to wrap augmentations as static transforms in MLJ
- It should just work

### Code Reuse

Brian brought up that the DLPipelines/MLJ agenda item was motivated by a desire to share code in the ecosystem wherever possible. This lead to a discussion on several topics:
- Standard metrics and penalties
	- Available separately in Flux, MLJ, and JuliaML/LearnBase.jl
	- There are two kinds of metrics implementations: functional vs type-based
		- Functional implementations are easier to grapple with and inline with Flux’s approach to losses
		- Type-based implementations allow for more creative operations applied to the losses/penalties themselves
		- Type-based implementations can make logging simpler
	- Logging of metrics and periodic updates
		- OnlineStats.jl is already used in FluxTraining.jl
- Visualization tools for logging
	- TensorBoardLogger.jl is the easiest to get up and running
	- Long-term tutorials with Makie.jl might be cool
