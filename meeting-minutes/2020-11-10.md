# Notes on 10 November 2020

## Agenda

- Reorganizing projects/design docs
- Maintenance of non-core repos / triage update
- Should we sync with [https://github.com/FluxML/fluxml.github.io/pull/73][1] on ecosystem documentation?
- [Proposed] Flux(Training)/DLPipelines and MLJ: are there any opportunities to share/integrate common functionality?
	  - If not, what (if anything) can be done to make it so?
- [WIP documentation][2] for DataAugmentation.jl
