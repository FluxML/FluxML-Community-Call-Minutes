### FastAI.jl updates

- Interfaces should be usable
- All datasets from fast.ai available
- LR finder implemented
- Pre-trained models from Metalhead working
	- Waiting on Flux v0.12 release to release new Metalhead.jl
- Tutorials added for image classification
- Image segmentation almost complete
	- Trouble with loss function
- Image classification + segmentation support data augmentations

### Pollen.jl

FastAI.jl uses Pollen.jl for documentation instead of Publish.jl. Pollen.jl has live incremental updates which is important for a documentation source as complex as FastAI.jl. Publish.jl takes too long regenerate the HTML when the source changes.

Publish.jl and Pollen.jl share the same source syntax.
Swapping out Publish.jlâ€™s server for Pollen.jl at some point?
- No, Pollen.jl uses XML to represent the source which is incompatible with Publish.jl

### FastAI.jl GSoC

Open discussion on potential GSoC proposals with students that attended.
