# Notes on 21 Apr. 2023

## Agenda

Discuss naming for the following PRs:
- https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl/pull/2222
- https://github.com/FluxML/Optimisers.jl/pull/139

## Minutes

Discussion of https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl/pull/2222:
- PR is ready to go
- Add a doc section [here](https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/models/advanced/) explaining overloading `testmode!` for stochastic layers
- Add forward pointers to doc section from docstring
- Some discussion of future steps:
    - Have a single `setactive!(m, mode)` and just `trainmode!(m)` / `testmode!(m)`

Discussion of https://github.com/FluxML/Optimisers.jl/pull/139:
- All options proposed in the PR seem off
    - either breaking/bending existing semantics
    - taking up an infix operator in a package seems poor form given that Julia is not permissive about this
- The original naming of `OptimiserChain` is discussed here: https://github.com/FluxML/Optimisers.jl/pull/9#discussion_r566559542
- This does not seem worth introduce odd syntax
- Users can do `import ... as ...` or `const ... = OptimiserChain` quite easily (including aliasing infix operators)
- Best option might be a unexported verb: `Optimisers.chain(...)` returns a `OptimiserChain`

Discussion of https://github.com/FluxML/Optimisers.jl/pull/135:
- The structure is no longer a tree...so calling it a tree is misleading
- Make a distinction between the names for developers of Optimisers.jl vs. users/rule writers
- Users + rule writers should only ever see `state`
- Internally we replace `tree` with `opt_state`

Discussion of https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl/pull/2156/files#diff-54816e9a4978b8c02648fdb29ebfd6d794452dbac8a28d0e84a5e2cc646a3fbf:
- No longer need a complicated type restriction
- It can just be `x::AbstractVecOrMat`
