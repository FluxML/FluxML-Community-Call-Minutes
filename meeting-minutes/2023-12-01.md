Discussion on printing
- we want to follow Julia convention of having the print out be copy-able
- prefer to use `IOContext(..., :limit => true)` to generate ellipses for array printing
- clean up Flux show code and offer something like [Flax's `tabulate`](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.linen/module.html#flax.linen.Module.tabulate)
