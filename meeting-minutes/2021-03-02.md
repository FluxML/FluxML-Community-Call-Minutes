# Notes on 2 March 2021

## Agenda

- Metalhead.jl updates
	- PR now ready for review
	- Needs some small clean-up and tests
- FastAI.jl updates

## Minutes

*informal meeting (off-agenda) due to lower attendance and minimal updates*

We discussed some priorities for future work:
- GNNs
- Distributed training

We discussed how to integrate Dagger.jl for distributed computing. Probably will use an external package like FluxDagger.jl that translates Flux models into DAGs for execution.

We discussed splitting out CUDA.jl related code from NNlib.jl into a sub-package. This will make working with multiple backends like AMDGPU.jl easier.

We also discussed how some NNlib kernels can be simplified into single implementations eventually with KernelAbstractions.jl.
