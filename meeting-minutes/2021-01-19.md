### Documentation updates

Centralized Publish.jl theme:
- Kyle will make a central Publish.jl theme repo
- Use sidebar formatting from FluxTraining.jl
- Make PRs to existing package repos to use the theme with Pkg.Artifacts

### DataAugmentation.jl

Registration:
- Lorenz needs to add some missing (stochastic) augmentations; this should not block registration
- Make sure docs are clean, then register
- Docs need more tutorial-like pages
	- Dale will meet with Lorenz to add the medical imaging user story

### Optimisers.jl

Kyle working on an [optimizers overhaul][6] in FluxML/Optimisers.jl.

Working with FluxTraining.jl:
- Get ParameterSchedulers.jl working with vanilla Flux first
- Replace Animations.jl backend with ParameterSchedulers.jl
- High-level API remains the same

Side-discussion on [training loops][7]:
- Adding hooks into vanilla Flux loop is a rabbit-hole to FluxTraining.jl
- Need more docs around the complete training loop
- See the linked issue for more details

### FastAI.jl

Need to add issues to for FastAI.jl to get beginner-friendly tasks for new contributors.
- Wrap existing ecosystem packages using fast.ai constructs

Lorenz already working on a FastAI.jl “beta” that will flesh out repo skeleton.

Need pre-trained models:
- Waiting on [https://github.com/FluxML/Metalhead.jl/pull/70][8]
	- Need to train models on ImageNet
	- Anyone can help by cloning the fork and going to the `training` folder
- Lorenz has [https://github.com/lorenzoh/FluxModels.jl][9]
	- Integrate with Metalhead.jl
- Metalhead.jl for CV models
- Transformers.jl for NLP models

### Tutorials

Check with Jeremy about porting fast book
