Join the long-term conversation under the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/JuliaCommunity/ML-Coordination-Tracker/discussions). This is also where we post more structured design documentation and Q&A about Flux. If you have an idea for improving the ecosystem, you can post it there.

This is still very much a work in progress, and **we welcome all contributions**! For a list of issues and action points, see the [general issues project](https://github.com/JuliaCommunity/ML-Coordination-Tracker/projects/5). More specific projects can be found under the [Projects tab](https://github.com/JuliaCommunity/ML-Coordination-Tracker/projects).

Many of our contributions might be spread across several repos, so if you want to get involved and don't know where to start, you should ping us on Zulip. Or if you see that someone is assigned to a specific issue, you can DM them on Zulip.
